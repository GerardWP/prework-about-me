      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi my name's Gerard, I enjoy music, learning, travel and good conversation. I currently work full time as a graphic/web desiger.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>A town  called Bright, in NE Victoria. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like going to gigs, camping, reading, kayaking, yoga, catching up with friends, relaxing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I like to keep my dreams private as much as I can. But it's good...trust me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Brunswick West</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always enjoyed things mathematical and to me coding works the brain in a similar way. I enjoy learning new things and find coding expecially satasfying because, like maths, it makes sense while also alowing you to be creative in how you apply it. I want to be a web developer because it interests me, it's an exciting field, I think I could be good at it, and the possibilities are plenty and growing every day.</p>
